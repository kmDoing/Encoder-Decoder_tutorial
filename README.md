# Encoder-Decoder_tutorial
In this repo I implement the Frick encoder-decoder tutorial from his Medium article.

I makes 1 big change:
I use the Kaggle ccn_dailymail dataset instead of EdinburghNLP/Xsum.

The Frick_encoder_decoder.ipynb is the development file.
The folder Enc_dec_prod is the notebook modified to reflect production-level changes.
